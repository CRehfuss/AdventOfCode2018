# AdventOfCode2018

This is my first go through of Advent of Code 2018. My solutions are in python in Jupyter notebooks.

WARNING: I haven't updated my code to be ultra efficient or fast, but darn it--it works! Also the notebooks contain answer SPOILERS (duh)!

(My git got messed up, so all uploads by Claire Rehfuss is me)
